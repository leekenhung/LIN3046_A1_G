Scenario description: Lt. Col. Gordon Tall is communicating with Capt. James ‘Bugger’ Staros by a (for lack of a better word) 
special war phone. Staros is leading a group of soldiers in an attempt to take the hill in which the Japanese are crammed up in. 
They’re facing extreme resistance and many soldiers are dying, and he and his men are hiding behind a ledge waiting 
for reinforcements. Tall orders Staros to send all of his men to attack the Japanese directly, and Staros knows in doing that,
he would be sentencing his fellow soldiers to death. He argues with Tall and refuses to obey a direct order from him; 
Tall goes speechless, as does everyone in Staros’s squadron.

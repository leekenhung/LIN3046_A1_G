Scenario Description: All Woody Allen films are dialogue-driven. His scripts are influenced by several literary authors, and most of his texts could be easily adapted into a play. He also borrows often from the Hollywood golden era and classic foreign masterpieces, such as “Casablanca”, “8½”, “Citizen Kane” and “The Seventh Seal”. “Manhattan” is a mixture of many of his inspirations, including New York, which may be considered his biggest one. Allen plays Isaac, a chatty New Yorker who’s dating a 17-year-old named Tracy. He doesn’t seem to be taking the relationship seriously, but Tracy has fallen in love with him. Throughout the whole movie, Isaac treats Tracy like a child and is condescending toward her in an attempt to undermine their mutual affection. He prefers the pseudo-intellectual Mary, but he would rather be with Tracy if not for her age. In the end, Isaac’s attempts to seduce Mary are hampered by his best friend. Isaac runs toward Tracy’s building, realizing that he had always loved her, while the wonderful soundtrack transports us into ancient Hollywood history. Gershwin’s famous “Rhapsody in Blue” carries the whole movie until the end. She’s getting ready to leave for London on a scholarship, and when he realizes that it’s too late to convince her, Tracy comforts him by saying that when she comes back in six months, she will still love him. Isaac is not so sure about that, but is convinced when Tracy says the famous line: “You have to have a little faith in people.” This scene nicely ties up the film in a nice bow. Shot in glorious black and white, and with amazing performances from both actors, it’s one of the greatest dialogues in film history.

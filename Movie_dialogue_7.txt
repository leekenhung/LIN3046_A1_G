Movie genre: Crime, Drama

Movie dialogue: Matthew Poncelet: “You ever get lonely?” Sister Helen Prejean: “Yeah, Sure. Sometimes on Sundays when 
I smell the neighborhood barbecues, and I hear all the kids laughing and I’m sitting in my room (laughs) 
I feel like a fool.”



Scenario description: Susan Sarandon plays Sister Helen Prejean, a nun who’s intrigued by the story of a death row 
inmate named Matthew (Sean Penn) and his possible innocence. She tries to understand him, little by little, 
in an attempt to figure out his participation in the crimes of which he’s accused. Though Sister Prejean’s main goal 
is for him to finally show regret and accept Jesus Christ, she struggles on every step of the way to protect this 
man from himself.

The scene takes place in an isolated jail cell for death row inmates. Sister Prejean is visiting Matthew 
the day before his execution; they’re separated by a thick glass and a cop is sitting behind him, 
ever watchful of any move he makes. Although the characters are facing each other in a classic shot-reverse 
shot style, we can see both of their faces at all times because they’re reflected on the glass.

They talk about God and the divine salvation Matthew wants to be worthy of. The nun explains 
to him the sacrifice that’s involved and he’s not happy about it.

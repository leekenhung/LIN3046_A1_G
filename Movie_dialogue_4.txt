Movie dialogue: Mia: “Don’t you hate that?” Vincent: “What?” M: “Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it’s 
necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?” V: “I don’t know. That’s a good question.” 
M: “That’s when you know you’ve found somebody special. When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.”

Scenario description: Vega is having a chat with his boss’s wife in this cool 50’s themed restaurant. 
Steve Buscemi, who played a guy that hated tipping in Tarantino’s “Reservoir Dogs”, is now a waiter. 
He takes the couple’s orders while they make small talk, and their outstanding chemistry carries the entire scene. 
This is the first time they’re having a proper conversation, but the characters are so well fleshed out and 
the actors are so good at their jobs that it all feels natural. The dialogue culminates with the classic dance competition we all know.

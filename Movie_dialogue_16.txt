Movie Name: Hunger

Release date of the movie: 31 October 2008 (United Kingdom)

Movie genre: historical drama 

Movie dialogue: Father Dominic Moran: “I want to know whether your intent is just purely to commit suicide here.”
Bobby Sands: “You want me to argue about the morality of what I’m about to do and whether it’s really suicide or not? For one, you’re calling it suicide. I call it murder. And that’s just another wee difference between us two. We’re both Catholic men, both Republicans. But while you were poaching salmon in beautiful Kilrea, we were being burnt out of our house in Rathcoole. Similar in many ways, Dom, but life and experiences focused our beliefs differently. You understand me?”

Scenario Description: Steve McQueen cast young Magneto and Davos Seaworth for his first feature film. I was surprised when I didn’t encounter any swordfights or metal bending/murdering in the whole film’s runtime, although I did came across a sweet dialogue scene.
Michael Fassbender plays Bobby Sands, an Irish republican who leads a hunger strike while imprisoned. He has a conversation with Father Dominic about his life, religion and motives, a relaxed chat while smoking and displaying a great amount of chemistry. The camera is static as both men interrogate one another.
Both actors do a great job, as filming a single take from the same angle and with an extreme amount of lines to remember couldn’t have been an easy task. Though we only see their shapes due to the dim lighting for most of the scene, the performers are able to express every emotion and keep us interested for almost 30 minutes and with minimal cuts.

Movie Name: My Dinner with Andre

Release date of the movie: October 11, 1981 (United States)

Movie genre: comedy-drama

Movie dialogue: Andre:" Our minds are just focused on these goals and plans, which in themselves are not reality.” Wally: “Goals and plans are not… they’re fantasy. They’re part of a dream life."

Scenario Description: This movie consists of a single scene of dialogue, stretched for over two hours, in which the protagonist reunites with an old friend named Andre, who has been involved in an interesting series of activities in a search for real meaning in his life.

Wally calmly listens as his friend enthusiastically describes what he has been doing all this time: being buried alive, making a weird play with no audience in a forest, adopting a Buddhist monk for a few weeks, joining a group of people who were trying to achieve a kind of enlightened extra-human state. Andre seems to be into new age culture, and he and Wally are very dissimilar.

Watching them talk for almost two hours nonstop is quite interesting. The protagonist disagrees with Andre’s extremism about how the modern world is pointless, but he does appreciate the comforts that technology offers, whereas Andre prefers a more animalistic and natural state of being and savagely critiques the vices and problems of our contemporary civilization.

Their philosophical dissertations show some of the blatant issues Western society has to face, such as alienation, routine, self-deception, and lack of empathy. It’s an analysis you shouldn’t miss.

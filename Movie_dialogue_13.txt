Movie dialogue: Erica Albright: “You are probably going to be a very successful computer person. But you’re going to go 
through life thinking that girls don’t like you because you’re a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of 
my heart, that that won’t be true. It’ll be because you’re an asshole.”

Scenario description: Mark seems to be obsessed with final clubs and prestige, while Erica doesn’t really see 
the point of those groups. He cares too much about his reputation and is portrayed as a very insecure guy,
and then, she said this line,“You are probably going to be a very successful computer person. But you’re going to go 
through life thinking that girls don’t like you because you’re a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of 
my heart, that that won’t be true. It’ll be because you’re an asshole.”; from the get go, Zuckerberg’s whole motivation to create Facebook is 
to have revenge on his now ex-girlfriend after this scene, which of course isn’t true to real events.

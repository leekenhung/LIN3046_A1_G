Movie dialogue: Bonasera: “How much shall I pay you?” [The Don turns away dismissively, but Bonasera stays on] Don 
Corleone: “Bonasera, Bonasera, what have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you’d come to me in friendship, 
this scum who ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by some chance an honest man like yourself 
made enemies they would become my enemies. And then, they would fear you.” B: “Be my friend… Godfather.”

Scenario description: In this scene, a man is asking Vito to avenge his daughter after a group of guys ruthlessly 
beat her. Corleone is insulted by the way this man is treating him, like he was some unknown vulgar hitman; 
the Godfather indirectly calls him a hypocrite, because he only acknowledges their friendship when he wants a favor.

Movie dialogue: Selma: “You like the movies, don’t you?” Bill Houston: “I love the movies. I just love the musicals.
” Selma: “But isn’t it annoying when they do the last song in the films?” B: “Why?” 
S: “Because you just know when it goes really big… and the camera goes like out of the roof… and you just know it’s going to end. 
I hate that. I would leave just after the next to last song… and the film would just go on forever.”


Scenario description: This dialogue scene is the pivotal one of the entire film; the essential character development 
is delivered in a fluent way by gestures and outstanding acting by David Morse and (my personal favorite actress) Björk.
In the film, the protagonist is going blind due to a hereditary condition. She’s working overtime in a factory 
to save money to pay for her son’s eye surgery; Selma’s only wish is that her son would live a better life with normal eyesight.
She’s talking with her friend Bill after a busy day, and Selma notices that something’s wrong with him 
and asks him about it. Bill confesses, as he weeps, that he’s broke, he inherited a lot of money, but it’s all gone. 
The protagonist feels the necessity to open her heart to him in this difficult time; Selma confesses that she’s going blind,
and can barely cover basic expenses while saving up to Gene’s surgery. The protagonist talks about her coping mechanisms 
that will constitute the musical element of the film.

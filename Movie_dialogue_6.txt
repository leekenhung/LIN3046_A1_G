Movie genre: Drama, Fantasy

Movie dialogue: Antonius Block: “We must make an idol of our fear, and call it god.”

Scenario description: Their best scene together takes place in a small church, where Antonius is 
confessing his sins to a priest through the metal bars of a confessionary. The main character wishes to 
believe in God, but is frustrated by the lack of proof of his existence; faith is not enough for him, and it 
saddens his soul. The priest is actually Death in disguise, and he asks Antonius a few questions in an attempt to find out why 
he doesn’t want to die. Antonius says he desires knowledge, to meet God in person, to uncover the mystery; 
he’s tired of assumptions and empty prayers.

The whole setup for this dialogue is masterful. The lighting points out the duality of Death; 
he’s covered in a black robe, but his face is white and shiny. The performances are passionate 
and the dilemma the main character faces is the most universal of all, making the scene particularly endearing, due to the 
fact that anyone could relate to Antonius’s existential suffering.

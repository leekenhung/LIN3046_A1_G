Movie dialogue: The Joker: “Don’t talk like one of them. You’re not! Even if you’d like to be. 
To them, you’re just a freak, like me! They need you right now, but when they don’t, they’ll cast you out, 
like a leper! You see, their morals, their code, it’s a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. 
They’re only as good as the world allows them to be. I’ll show you. When the chips are down, these… 
these civilized people, they’ll eat each other. See, I’m not a monster. I’m just ahead of the curve.”

Scenario description: Batman interrogates the clown in order to find out the location of Harvey Dent. 
The Joker, being a jerk and all, isn’t going to let Bruce go rescue his friends without philosophically 
analyzing his situation like an evil insufferable Socrates. Batman gets violent after his enemy reveals 
he also kidnapped his former girlfriend, and that he’s going to have to choose only one to save.

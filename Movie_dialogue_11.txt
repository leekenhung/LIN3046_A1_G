Movie dialogue: Mike Shiner: “Okay, just stay with me. ‘I’m the wrong person to ask,’ he says, but what is that, 
what is the intention in that? Is he fed up with the subject so he’s changing it, is he deflecting guilt over the marriage? 
And here’s the thing, you’ve got four lines after that that all say the same thing. ‘I didn’t even know the man, 
I only heard his name mentioned in passing, I wouldn’t know, you’d have to know the particulars…’ 
The point is, you don’t know the guy, we f – king get it. Make it work with one line: ‘I didn’t even know the man.’ Right?”
Riggan: “Right. Yeah. You know my lines too, huh?” M: “Can we not get hung up on knowing lines?”


Scenario description: Keaton’s character, Riggan, needs a new actor for the play he’s directing, so his agent calls 
Mike (Edward Norton), a Broadway star known for being quite hard to work with. Their encounter starts abruptly when Mike begins to 
criticize the script, wanting to start rehearsing a random scene without paying attention to the technicalities; this leads to 
an awesome showdown between these two great actors where Norton’s character proves his talent, getting the part and 
Riggan’s admiration along with it. The dialogue was based on a real conversation between the director of the movie and Edward Norton, 
in which the actor interrogated Iñárritu about the script and the purposes of each character.
